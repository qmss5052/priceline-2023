Food lovers can spend a lifetime sampling the city’s pasta—impossibly buttery cacio e pepe, rich and meaty carbonara. Art fanatics can tour masterpiece after masterpiece by the likes of Michelangelo and Raphael. And history buffs can explore an absurd amount of ancient sites, from the Pantheon to the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain. But just when you think you have Rome figured out, it surprises you. Just look at its nightlife, which rivals any European capital with its up-all-night energy and legendary clubbing. And even if your bar-crawl days are behind you, it’s worth joining locals in the Roman tradition of an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) to toast this eternal city."

From days spent strolling the Gothic Quarter to afternoons at the beach and nights partying ‘til dawn, the city is magnetic. While tapas and bustling mercados are worth every bit of attention they get in guidebooks, Barcelona’s true crown jewel is the work of Antoni Gaudí. His iconic creations, like the jaw-dropping Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, are instantly recognizable and have fueled millions of travel dreams. You won’t be the only tourist here (especially during the summer), but even amid the crowds you’ll find your own Mediterranean magic any time of year."

Today, you can experience those influences firsthand by exploring its mahalles (neighborhoods). From the holy sites of Sultanahmet and the 19th-century European elegance of Beyoğlu to the high fashion of Nişantaşı, the vibrant cafe society of Kadıköy and the football-loving streets of Beşiktaş, it’s easy to see why travelers say that Istanbul isn’t just one city, but multiple cities within one."

Even City Hall is astounding, with its white pinnacles and neo-Gothic features. A self-guided architecture tour can begin by the great bear statue in the central Puerta del Sol.

And while the capital of the Veneto is undoubtedly a stunner, it’s also a very real city. The Grand Canal and Piazza San Marco are the center of tourist activity, and the surrounding winding streets are filled with stylish cafes and gelaterias, souvenir shops and one-off boutiques, as well as gorgeous Renaissance palaces and Gothic churches. Once you’ve ticked off the must-see landmarks (don’t miss the Campanile and Gallerie dell'Accademia), get to know the lesser known neighborhoods like Cannaregio, Dorsoduro, and Castello where locals crowd lowkey trattorias for afternoon aperitivo."

Once a small village with olive and citrus groves, this Spanish city now wows with its high-rise hotels and non-stop nightlife, though the historic center with its blue-domed 18th-century church and picturesque alleyways recalls its quainter past.

Days here start on postcard-worthy Macao Beach and might end inside of a cave nightclub. And when you’re not soaking up the sun or dancing the night away, all-day indulgence is the name of the game at Punta Cana’s impeccable all-inclusive resorts, from the electrified Hard Rock Punta Cana to the serene Le Sivory Punta Cana.

Montego Bay has excellent duty-free shopping, vibrant nightlife, and calm waters. Browse the local handicrafts at the open-air Harbour Street market, or the ""hip strip"" shops of Gloucester Avenue.
